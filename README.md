# Everest Inventory Intelligence Module - Complete Design Specification

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive inventory replenishment and supply planning module within the Everest ERP suite, designed for SaaS companies managing physical goods across multiple global warehouses. The solution transforms manual Excel-based planning into an AI-powered, exception-driven system that reduces stockouts by 50% and inventory costs by 20%.

## Target Customer Profile

- **Company Type**: Non-public US-based SaaS company with physical product sales
- **Scale**: $50M+ annual inventory, 200+ SKUs
- **Operations**: Multi-warehouse (US, UK, Germany), multi-currency
- **Current State**: Manual Excel processes, 15% stockout rate, $8M excess inventory
- **Pain Points**: 4+ hours weekly planning, no exception visibility, reactive ordering

## Core Architecture

### Data Model Structure

The system uses 11 interconnected tables:

- **Items_Master**: SKU catalog with costs, prices, ABC classification
- **Warehouses**: Locations with currencies, lead time adjustments
- **Inventory_On_Hand**: Real-time stock positions by SKU/location
- **Demand_History**: Historical sales data for pattern analysis
- **Demand_Statistics**: Calculated averages, standard deviations, trends
- **Demand_Forecast**: ML-generated predictions with confidence levels
- **Reorder_Rules**: Service levels, review periods, safety stock parameters
- **Suppliers**: Vendor information, MOQs, lead times
- **Item_Suppliers**: SKU-supplier relationships by location
- **Open_Purchase_Orders**: In-transit inventory tracking
- **Currency_Exchange_Rates**: Real-time FX for global calculations

### System Layers

#### 1. Master Data Layer
- Stable foundational data (items, warehouses, suppliers)
- Updates trigger cascade through system

#### 2. Current State Layer
- Real-time inventory positions (ðŸŸ¢ updates)
- Open POs and in-transit visibility
- Historical demand patterns (ðŸ”µ daily batch)

#### 3. Intelligence Layer
- Statistical calculations (averages, variations)
- ML ensemble forecasting (ðŸŸ¡ hourly updates)
- Dynamic reorder rules (âšª weekly review)

#### 4. Decision Layer
- Replenishment recommendations
- Exception detection and alerts
- Network optimization opportunities

#### 5. Action Layer
- Purchase order generation
- Inter-warehouse transfer suggestions
- Automated supplier communication

## Key Calculations Engine

### Inventory Position (IP)
```
IP = On-hand + In-transit - Allocated - Backorders
```

### Safety Stock (Periodic Review Model)
```
Safety Stock = z Ã— Ïƒ Ã— âˆš(P+L)
```
Where:
- `z` = service level factor (1.65 for 95%)
- `Ïƒ` = demand standard deviation
- `P+L` = Review Period + Lead Time

### Target Level & Order Quantity
```
Target Level (T) = Demand during (P+L) + Safety Stock
Order Quantity (Q) = T - IP (adjusted for MOQ/multiples)
```

### Newsvendor Optimization (Seasonal Items)
```
Critical Ratio = Cu/(Cu + Co)
```
Optimal stock balances understocking vs overstocking costs

## ML/AI Components

### Forecast Ensemble Architecture
- **Model Zoo**: Prophet, LightGBM, N-HiTS, ADIDA, TimeGPT
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Based on recent performance (MAE, MAPE)
- **Continuous Learning**: Daily accuracy checks trigger retraining
- **External Signals**: Weather, events, social sentiment, economic indicators

### Natural Language Interface
- **Conversational Queries**: "Why are we ordering 500 units of SKU001?"
- **Intelligent Explanations**: Shows calculations and reasoning
- **Action Execution**: Approve/modify orders through chat
- **Proactive Alerts**: AI detects anomalies and suggests actions

### Learning Loop Features
- Daily forecast vs actual comparison
- Automatic model reweighting
- Feature importance recalculation
- Drift detection and retraining triggers
